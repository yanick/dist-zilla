# DELAY CORE ATTRIBUTE INIT

We might want something like $zilla->name to come from some plugin that
converts from main_module, or yadda yadda.  This will allow
register-on-the-fly of plugins because we can construct the Zilla before we
know all its required attribute values.

We'll probably mark those values as LazyRequired and SetOnce.

## ATTRIBUTES TO FIX, IN ORDER:

* main_module, name -- interdependent

* abstract

* version - it's unique and should be simplified
* copyright_{holder,year} - should come from a plugin somehow, too
* license
* authors

* root?
