=head1 DESCRIPTION

This represents a file whose contents will be generated on demand from a
callback or method name.

It has one attribute, C<code>, which may be a method name (string) or a
coderef.  When the file's C<content> method is called, the code is used to
generate the content.  This content is I<not> cached.  It is recomputed every
time the content is requested.
