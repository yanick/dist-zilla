=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dzil clean

This command removes some files that are created during build, test, and
install.  It's a very thin layer over the C<L<clean|Dist::Zilla/clean>> method
on the Dist::Zilla object.  The documentation for that method gives more
information about the files that will be removed.
